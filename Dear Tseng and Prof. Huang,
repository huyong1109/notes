Dear Tseng and Prof. Huang,

So sorry for the delay. Here is the updated draft. The major revision is redoing the experiments according to suggestions from Dr. Tseng, that is, using a constant grid aspect ratio in section 4.1. 

Would you please take a look and provide some suggestions for future revision?  Thanks so much!


Best,

Yong
